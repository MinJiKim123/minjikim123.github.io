Hi! I'm Minji, a software engineer based in Toronto. 

I focus mostly on back-end development on either web or standalone application. But I also enjoy designing website at meantime. My goal as a software engineer is to satisfy or meet requirements of the user of my application and provide best user-experience. I love logics, data structures and always focus on details when coding.
                
I have recently graduated from Centennial College with honours designation majoring in Software Engineering Technology and currently seeking actively for full-time Software Engineer position.
